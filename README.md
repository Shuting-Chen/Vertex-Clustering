# Vertex-Clustering
This is a computer graphics project. Mesh simplification: vetex-clustering research. Meaning: drawing triangles for simulating object will cost a lot of time each time we draw it if there are too many points and too many triangles to draw withing a certain area. So do the mesh simplification will reduce the vertices and the triangles to be draw, so the time that using for drawing the picture will be greatly reduced. There are several technologies for reducing the points like vertex clustering, edge collapse, vertex removal, vertex decimation. I use vertex clustering.
